# Student-Management-Application
The Student Management Application is a Spring Boot project designed to manage student records efficiently. It provides a RESTful API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data. The application is structured with modular components adhering to best practices in software development.
Below is an overview:

Key Features:
Student Registration:
Allows users to add new student records with attributes like name, email, address, father's name, phone number, and class name.
Retrieve Students:
Fetches all student records or retrieves a specific student's details by ID.
Update Student Details:
Enables modifications to existing student records.
Delete Student Records:
Facilitates the removal of a student's record using their unique ID.

Technologies Used:

Backend Framework: Spring Boot
Data Persistence: JPA (Java Persistence API) with Hibernate
Database: Integrated using JPA Repository (supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

Annotations:
@Entity, @Id for defining data models.
@RestController, @Autowired for RESTful APIs and dependency injection.
@RequestMapping, @PostMapping, @GetMapping, etc., for routing and HTTP method handling.
Dependency Management: Maven

Key Components:

Controller:
Provides REST endpoints for client interactions (/api/Student, /api/Students).
Handles HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Service Layer:
Encapsulates business logic for student management.
Implements a clean interface for CRUD operations.

DAO Layer:
Interfaces with the database using JpaRepository for persistence operations.

Data Model:
Defines a Student entity with fields like id, name, email, etc.

Use Cases:
Manage student information for schools, colleges, or coaching centers.
Enhance scalability with the ability to extend functionality, such as integrating authentication or advanced filtering.
